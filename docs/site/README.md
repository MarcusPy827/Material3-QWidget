# Material3-QWidget Docs
Welcome to Material3-QWidget Docs!! We use Vite + React to host our docs.

To read the docs, you will need to have `Node.JS` environment and `pnpm` ready in the system.

Then, at the root directory of the project, run the following command: 

```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will pull a local server up. The default address should be at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

The port could change if there is another program occupying the port, the way to get the port number is to check your terminal output: 

```bash
➜  docs git:(main) ✗ pnpm dev

> m3qw.docs@ dev /home/marcus/Desktop/Repositories/Public/material3-qwidget/docs
> react-router dev

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

Hence, in the example above, the port is `5173`.
